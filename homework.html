        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hola, my name is Thomas Urdinola! I am currently a third year Computer Science student with a Cybersecurity minor at
            the University of Maryland: College Park. A couple of cool things about me is that my parents are Colombian, so spanish
            was my first language growing up. Last summer, I had the opportunity to be a Software Engineer Intern at Freddie Mac, where
            we mainly focused on moving data to a cloud-based database system. This upcoming summer however, I am proud to announce that I'll
            be a Software Engineer intern for Microsoft! A dream come true :)
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my interests include: Programming Languages, Algorithms, Quantum Computing, and ML/AI.
            Nevertheless, I am always intersted in learning new things in CS. In school, I am a bootcamp member in the App Dev club and executive team
            lead for the College Success Scholars program, a Black and Latino male program that helps students of that race stay on track with their academic
            and professional skills. Additionally, I am a Teaching Assistant for CMSC330: Organization of Programming Languages, I like OCaml a lot hehe
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from academics, I love to watch/play soccer, with FC Barcelona being my favorite team. In addition, I love to go thrifting, and listening to music. \
            Thank you so much for taking the time in getting to know me!!
